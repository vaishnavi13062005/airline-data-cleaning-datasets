 Airline Data Cleaning & Visualization

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization on a small airline dataset using Python. It covers handling of duplicates, missing values, categorization, and visual exploration using Matplotlib and Seaborn.



 Contents

-  DataFrame creation
-  Duplicate removal
-  Missing value detection using `isnull()`
-  Categorization of on-time performance
-  Visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`



 Visualizations

The following charts are included in the notebook:

1. **Bar Chart** – On-Time Performance by Carrier  
2. **Pie Chart** – Distribution of Performance Categories (High/Medium/Low)  
3. **Scatter Plot** – Cancellation Rate vs Average Delay



 On-Time Performance Categorization

Performance is categorized based on the `OnTime` percentage:
- High: ≥ 85%
- Medium: 80–84.9%
- Low: < 80%


How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab
3. Run all cells to explore the data
